// Give a relevant example of Promises

/*  
    Promise can be any of the three states
        1. pending (initial state)
        2. fulfilled
        3. rejected
    When it changes from pending state to either fulfilled or rejected state, it can be handled with then or catch, respectively.
    
    let promise = fetch(url);

    promise
        .then(()=>{
            console.log('Promise resolved');
        })
        .catch(()=>{
            console.log('Promise rejected');
        })
